## :warning: Important Possible Breaking Changes for Versions :warning:

### 1.0.1 => 1.1.0

In this version the namespaces for the model where corrected to the name of the project.

This means that all namespaces which previously where named `IL2CarrerReviverModel` will now be named `IL2CareerModel`. 
Since this is a breaking change please consider this before updating

## Getting started

> :warning: For now the library is using [Microsoft Dependency Injection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection).
> This is the only way to get this into a good working state for now.

The getting started part need to be written,
for now please refer the code on [Github](https://github.com/XanatosX/IL2CarrerReviver/tree/master/src/IL2CareerToolset).

If you have any questions please feel free to ask them on [the discussion board](https://github.com/XanatosX/IL2CarrerReviver/discussions/26)
